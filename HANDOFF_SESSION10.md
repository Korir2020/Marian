# HANDOFF SESSION 10 (newest; older handoffs are stale)
STATE: full suite green (356 + new setup tests). B1 registration, B3 superadmin
review, B4 setup backend are BUILT. Teacher transfers built. Admin safety built.
NEXT, in order:
1. B2 applicant verification: no SMS provider, so use EMAIL OTP (decision pending).
   POST /api/school-registration/verify/, 10 min expiry, max 5 attempts, hashed code,
   never log codes, audit "school_admin_verified".
2. B5/B6/B7 frontend: setup wizard UI (reuse Setup.jsx), register-your-school
   screens, superadmin review screens. Use GET /api/setup/ and POST /api/setup/complete/.
3. Fix JWT SIGNING_KEY: it is 31 bytes, must be 32+; set via environment variable.
4. staticfiles/ dir warning: fix before deployment.
5. Later: school suspend, financial workflows, analytics + AI features, backups.
GIT: repo https://github.com/Korir2020/Marian (private). Push using `gh auth login`
(browser device login). Never paste tokens into chats.
RULES: inspect before editing, tests first, run full suite, commit by name.

## UPDATE 2026-10-16 (branch onboarding-ui, NOT pushed yet)
DONE (build passes, 383 backend tests pass):
- SchoolStatus.jsx: applicant "Check my application" screen (Landing button, App.jsx route, uses POST /api/school-registration/status/).
- RegistrationReview.jsx: status filter and email-verified badge.
- Backend GET/PATCH /api/school/profile/ (api/profile_views.py, 10 tests in api/test_school_profile.py). Non-deputy school admin edits own school only. Reason: approval never filled location or county, so setup checklist "profile" could never complete.
- SetupWizard.jsx: shown at top of the school admin Setup tab. Checklist, profile form, Finish setup (/api/setup/complete/).
- Label "Senior / Secondary" (stored value stays "secondary").
NOT DONE: browser check of the new screens, auto-open wizard on first login, "resend code" (needs a backend endpoint), needs_information status.
OPEN: DJANGO_EMAIL_* and DJANGO_FRONTEND_URL on Render (registration returns 503 without SMTP); replace DJANGO_SECRET_KEY; check Marian-app repo and branch.
DEPLOY: Render deploys from original main. Backup: ~/marian-backup-2026-10-15.dump (keep it).

## UPDATE 2 (same day, branch onboarding-ui)
DONE since the note above (390 tests pass, build passes):
- Auto-open: a non-deputy school admin with setup_complete false lands on the Setup tab when the URL has no tab (App.jsx).
- Resend code: POST /api/school-registration/resend/ (api/resend_views.py, 7 tests). 60 s cooldown, max 5 sends in total, reuses SchoolRegStatusThrottle, audit "school_reg_resent", 503 without email. Button with countdown in SchoolRegistration.jsx.
STILL NOT DONE: needs_information status (admin request-info action, applicant reply path); browser check of all new screens; SMTP (DJANGO_EMAIL_*, DJANGO_FRONTEND_URL) so registration and resend work live; replace DJANGO_SECRET_KEY; check Marian-app repo and branch.

## UPDATE 3 (end of session, pushed to original main)
LIVE: onboarding UI (status screen, review filter and badge, /api/school/profile/, setup wizard, auto-open wizard, resend code) plus the landing button wrap fix. 390 backend tests pass, build passes.
NEXT SESSION, in order:
1. Browser check on the live site: Landing buttons (two rows, scroll to the bottom), school admin Setup tab wizard, superadmin Registrations Email badge and filter.
2. SMTP on Render: DJANGO_EMAIL_* and DJANGO_FRONTEND_URL (set in Render, never paste values in chat). Without them registration and resend return 503. Then test a real registration.
3. Replace DJANGO_SECRET_KEY (it appeared in earlier screenshots). Do it before real schools use the platform.
4. Check Marian-app (static site) repo, branch, root directory and build command in Render.
5. needs_information: add an admin "request_info" action with a required message (model field info_request_message already exists, no migration). First read how rejected registrations are handled to design the applicant resubmit path.
6. Check marian-db creation date (free Postgres expires about 30 days after creation, no Render backups). Keep ~/marian-backup-2026-10-15.dump.

## UPDATE 2026-10-16 (branch ui-pro, not merged, not browser-tested)
DONE on ui-pro (build passes each step):
- kit.jsx/kit.css: Dialog, ConfirmDialog, Tabs, Badge, EmptyState, Skeleton
- Charts.jsx: SVG trend and distribution, used in Analytics.jsx
- Exams.jsx results: class/stream scope switch, admission no, "No rank"
- AuditLog.jsx: new Audit tab (school admin and superadmin), uses /api/audit-logs/ (mark changes only)
- Shell: breadcrumb and "Active term" line (term prop from App.jsx)
- Platform.jsx: platform totals, school profile dialog
- StudentCenter.jsx: tabbed sections
- Marks.jsx: inline "Use 1 to 100" message
- Analytics insights card relabelled "Automated suggestions" (rule-based, not AI)
Backups of patched files were in /tmp (lost on Cloud Shell reset); git history is the rollback.

NEXT, in order:
1. Browser-test every screen above, as superadmin, school admin, teacher, parent. Fix before merging.
2. Housekeeping: rotate DJANGO_SECRET_KEY, fix 31-byte JWT signing key, SMTP on Render.
3. Frontend: teacher assignment (max 4 subjects, classes/streams per subject), notification center (categories, priority, preferences), parent portal polish, logo options, phone/accessibility pass, unauthorized and session-expired screens.
4. Backend with tests (do not invent endpoints): security center, school suspend and billing, platform health, fuller audit log.
5. Merge ui-pro into main only after step 1, then deploy.
RULES: inspect before editing, patch scripts assert one match, tests first, commit by name.
